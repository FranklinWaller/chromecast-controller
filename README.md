# chromecast-controller

This is a project to see if we can create a HTML controller that lets you control the actions on Chromecast.
The project requires you to have a phone with a chromecast compatible browser (One of the developers tests this on iOS with the chrome browser)

The controls we want in this chromecast controller/remote:

- Mouse movement and be able to click on a links. (A mouse pad on the middle of the controller)
- A D-Pad style buttons. (Binded to WSAD + arrow keys + 8,6,4,2 (right num))
- 4 buttons that bind to a for now unknown keys.
- A way to open the keyboard and send full text to the chromecast.

For now this is not finished but we appreciate any help that can be given. So don't be afraid to make a PR!
